## Game Of Life
The purpose of this project is to add logic to buttons that will update the 2d matrix of cells for each simulation.
- 'step' will run and render one step of the simulation
- 'play' will step the simulation every 100 milliseconds
- 'pause' will stop the simulation
- the simulation runs borderless
- plays simulation at different speeds

## WIP features:
- showing which buttons are active
- implementing the stamp feature
- allowing user to draw on the canvas for testing custom simulations
- resetting the canvas to original state.
